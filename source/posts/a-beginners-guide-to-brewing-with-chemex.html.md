**On the Possibility of Dictatorship.**

It’s possible. I mean

you can see it in the way we invest,

like motheaten peacocks,

in the bathetic consolations

of pissy displays of power:

it’s in the chat in the office,

between kowtower and kowtowed,

the swagger of a traffic warden

with shit for his tea,

the call centre worker, cheerlessly extant,

adhering to procedure;

it’s in the onanistic stomach lurch

of the library security guard

as his walkie talkie crackles;

even though he knows

it will likely only be

another call about the toilet

that won’t flush on the second floor.
